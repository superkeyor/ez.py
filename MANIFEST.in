# A "MANIFEST.in" is needed in certain cases where you need to package additional files 
# that python setup.py sdist (or bdist_wheel) don’t automatically include. 
# A MANIFEST.in file can be added in a project to define the list of files to include in the distribution 
# # built by the sdist command.
# When sdist is run, it will look for the MANIFEST.in file and interpret it to generate the MANIFEST file 
# that contains the list of files that will be included in the package.
